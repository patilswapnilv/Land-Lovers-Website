<h1>The Pocket Orchestra's Death Song</h1>

<p>
When Nana asked the pocket orchestra to come and play for her<br />
I didn’t know how to tell her they had broken up again<br />
Who was sent for but a lone trumpeter?
</p>

<p>
And so he played an air that hung still like a childhood<br />
She was hardly fooled, but nonetheless she told him it was very good<br />
Empty as evening, I dropped him to work
</p>

<p>
And there I was, with no one to my name anymore<br />
Alone by seventeen years of streamlining<br />
Redialling a number I had kept to order something
</p>

<p>
There is a shallow cutout water feature<br />
That’s shadowed by three-story structures<br />
A ghost pleading his case by them, woah yeah
</p>

<p>
That evening, my eyes were embarrassed<br />
The pollen assaulted the palate<br />
The ghost knew I had been to her<br />
And a death song came to life
</p>
