<h1>My Heart Was Angled</h1>

<p>
I am bound to love you until the end of recorded time<br />
Have the legislators lost their collective minds?<br />
It’s late in the evening<br />
Like Clapton before me:
</p>

<p>
I’m ‘Slow Hand’;<br />
I’ve taken to wearing the thin beard of a creep
</p>

<p>
For a while I thought my figures were Greek<br />
When you told me they were pleasingly oblique
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely thing to hear<br />
In the context of an advanced hour
</p>

<p>
My heart was angled<br />
And reeled in terrifyingly<br />
Oh my heart was angled, angled oh
</p>

<p>
And so we are contracted to each other indefinitely<br />
Do the common criminals watch interestedly?<br />
Or are they in mourning?<br />
For their younger selves, de-lined and flowering<br />
There are generations stricken on the grass<br />
Playing dead for the slowest kid in the class<br />
They assured her she was middlingly fast
</p>

<p>
It was the decent thing to do<br />
Too often, honesty is a front for cruelty
</p>

<p>
My heart was angled<br />
And reeled in terrifyingly<br />
Oh my heart was angled, angled oh
</p>
