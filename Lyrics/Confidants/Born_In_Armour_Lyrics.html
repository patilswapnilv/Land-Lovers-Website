<h1>Born In Armour</h1>

<p>
Who will lead my troops today?<br />
I would lead those boys astray<br />
So, whole worlds lie down for them<br />
She will teach them to be men<br />
Softly
</p>

<p>
CHORUS:<br />
It’s the way that she wears her armour<br />
It’s the way that she talks to them<br />
It’s the way that she wears her armour<br />
Was she born in armour?
</p>

<p>
Who will take these kids from me?<br />
Show them what they ought to see?<br />
Should they set their limbs to rest,<br />
She will show them who knows best<br />
Softly
</p>

<p>
CHORUS<br />
<br />
Who will lead my troops today?<br />
I would lead those boys astray<br />
Who will say ‘goodnight’ to them?<br />
Cause them to forget girlfriends?<br />
They are young and they are hopeless<br />
There is nothing I can do<br />
To make their English improve
</p>

<p>
CHORUS<br />
<br />
The song of her unremitting eye<br />
While her predecessors cry:<br />
“Was she born in armour?<br />
Was she born in armour?<br />
She was born in armour!<br />
She was born in armour!”
