<h1>Gravedigger</h1>

<p>
Oh darlin’, I was gonna marry you<br />
Instead I’ve played the old soldier purely to punish you<br />
In Poland, you told them I was funny and kind<br />
But like your Bonieks; your Latos; your Deynas<br />
Your data was from another time
</p>

<p>
Haven’t made you smile for ages on end<br />
And I can’t remember our last kiss
</p>

<p>
Honey pie, I am just a gravedigger for you<br />
I’m digging ‘til you’re disabused
</p>

<p>
To others, your love is still exotic<br />
You’re the African loot in an old French attic<br />
No worries – I know what’s in the pipeline<br />
On your dating-site profile, you’re damaged<br />
And docile and looking for a man
</p>

<p>
Who will make you smile at the very least<br />
And bring you to festivals, yes
</p>

<p>
Honey pie, I am just a gravedigger for you,<br />
I’m digging ‘til you’re disabused
</p>

<p>
Leaving it late to order again<br />
Holding my tongue, I had told you “eat early,<br />
And feel strong”
</p>

<p>
Oh Dziekenowski started well, digging for goals<br />
But soon became a gravedigger<br />
And Williamowski, he was lauded, famous and bold<br />
Remembered as a gravedigger<br />
So there is nothing I can do, love<br />
I am just a gravedigger for you.
