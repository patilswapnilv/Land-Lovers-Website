<h1>Is Nowhere Far Away Anymore?</h1>

<p>
I was looking through the dormer window<br />
At my children’s children in the neighbours’ garden<br />
And knowing then that they would soon discover<br />
How slow and abject was their father’s father
</p>

<p>
At other points in life, I’d thought of moving somewhere beautiful<br />
Where everyday existence didn’t taunt me through a terminal<br />
But always I’d say, “It’s too late”…
</p>

<p>
So douse me, douse me, douse me, douse me<br />
With the blood of Patagonians<br />
I’m tired of this life, you see<br />
Where everything I do is scrutinised<br />
Scrutinised like public money<br />
Or the hands of sex offenders
</p>

<p>
I’m going where there’s only peace and quiet for a fella<br />
Somewhere that hasn’t fallen to the kids of IT Tallaght<br />
A wilderness that’s crying out for one man to adore<br />
Is nowhere far away anymore?
</p>

<p>
Blind me, blind me, blind me, blind me<br />
With the sun of Anatolia<br />
I’ve no connection to my family<br />
But everything I do they scrutinise<br />
Scrutinise like private photos<br />
On the screens of jealous boyfriends
</p>

<p>
I’m stubbornly intractable, attracted to a mission<br />
Until I’m ex-ed in exile, I’ll be buried in revision<br />
And gravely do I go amongst the dead who must explore<br />
Is nowhere far away anymore?
</p>

<p>
Always I’d say, “It’s too late”<br />
Always I’d say, “It’s too late”
</p>
