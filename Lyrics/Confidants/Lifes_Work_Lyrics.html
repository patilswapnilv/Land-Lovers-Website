<h1>Life's Work</h1>

<p>
There’s a danger in speaking up<br />
When the powers that be find your lungs lacking<br />
Besides, did you want to be understood?<br />
If the time was right, bloody sure you would<br />
But the time was wrong; I’d a life’s work to do<br />
After I finished that walk with you
</p>

<p>
There’s no record of your voice<br />
I taped you at Christmas refusing your uncles a song<br />
What they wanted was yours alone<br />
You’ll enter eternity guarding your groans<br />
Your bones, bones, bones are a bleak masterpiece:<br />
Off with the camera, on with the fleece
</p>

<p>
There’s a blue swollen sea<br />
It comes rushing for me
</p>

<p>
In the days left in balance<br />
When you’ve left me your diaries, your daughters, your dockets<br />
Will I set aside time for each of those?<br />
Or wonder if Pharaohs were buried with more clothes?<br />
A ghost with a life’s work to do:<br />
Patrolling the body you’ll leave me to ruin
</p>

<p>
There’s a blue swollen sea<br />
It wants you to believe<br />
That the laws of the universe do not apply under it<br />
It comes rushing for me.
