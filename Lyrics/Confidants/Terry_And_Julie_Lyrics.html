<h1>Terry And Julie</h1>

<p>
Terry and Julie cross over the river<br />
Gladdened again by the sight of each other<br />
They’re famed for their simplicity
</p>

<p>
And it is their song that providence shuffles<br />
Onto my lips between splutters and sniffles<br />
Outstaying my welcome on the earth
</p>

<p>
Oh, what a century!<br />
To live and reign<br />
You kneel down to navigate<br />
The length and the breadth of a prayer<br />
Long have you languished in there.
</p>

<p>
Terry and Julie admire the sunset<br />
But a song removed, it’s not quarter to one yet<br />
Though the days pass like a second hand
</p>

<p>
Here in the front room, hooked to a contraption<br />
You do my ablutions and block my distraction:<br />
A grey matinée movie
</p>

<p>
Oh, what a century!<br />
To slip one’s chain<br />
The mother of mortals<br />
Constant and stable and scared<br />
Spinning the bad news she heard.
</p>

<p>
You kneel down to navigate<br />
The lone, level sands of a prayer<br />
But nobody’s in the know<br />
Nobody’s in my confidence.
