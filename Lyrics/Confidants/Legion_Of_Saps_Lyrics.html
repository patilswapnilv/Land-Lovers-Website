<h1>Legion Of Saps</h1>

<p>
Nearly unlivable, that mice-infested lodging<br />
Where I imagined cockroaches throughout the building<br />
Under the sofa that served as a receptacle<br />
For cans and coins and a pliable girl I could never ply
</p>

<p>
Oh here comes the legion<br />
Make way, let those eejits<br />
Into your evening to give it meaning
</p>

<p>
Leaving that hovel, I joined the aforementioned grouping<br />
We go out to restaurants, tell funny stories to women<br />
Tweaking the narrative to tighten, deepen, lighten<br />
We have to help at animal homes in the morning
</p>

<p>
Oh here comes the legion<br />
Make way, let those eejits<br />
Into your evening to give it meaning
</p>

<p>
In the analysis, we must forgive each other<br />
Every malpractice, this is the mark of the brothers<br />
All the way to Beaumont, where her husband ails<br />
Julieâ€™s own misfortune was to put wind in his sails
</p>

<p>
Oh here comes the legion<br />
Make way and let those eejits<br />
Into your evening to give it meaning
</p>
