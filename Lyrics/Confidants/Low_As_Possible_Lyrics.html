<h1>As Low As Possible</h1>

<p>
As I roved out, Westport Bridge Street<br />
Nearly twelve years old and my eyes were on my feet<br />
I was bang in step to those post-showband ballads<br />
And the hotel lobby promised Strawberry Beds and Sonny
</p>

<p>
As a lowly cipher then, that seemed encrypted: and I drifted<br />
Off on a song<br />
Sent from the Turkish winter, three cassettes for a tenner<br />
Played as low as possible
</p>

<p>
Then on a white Cretan terrace near the sun<br />
The breaks were fierce and the children always won<br />
The staff took their beatings well and stuck to singing<br />
Is She Really Going Out With Him?
</p>

<p>
Joe Jackson, Prefab Sprout and Tears for Fears: painted-on ears<br />
Offered a song<br />
Nothing I sought or wanted, music had been invented<br />
Played as low as possible
</p>

<p>
If there’s a moment, one moment of importance<br />
And that’s uncertain as life on other planets<br />
Then it’s the morning you landed in our garage<br />
Holding a camera, some distant scientist tracking your moves
</p>

<p>
You presented me, the native, with a clock around which to rock<br />
Oh, and a song<br />
Nothing I sought or wanted, music was re-invented<br />
Played as low as…<br />
Played as low as…
</p>
