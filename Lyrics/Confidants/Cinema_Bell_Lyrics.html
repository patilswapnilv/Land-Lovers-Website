<h1>The Cinema Bell</h1>

<p>
I was talking again at an assembly of friends<br />
We were close, we were close, we were close to the end<br />
We had a blood connection and other difficulties<br />
We don’t write memoirs, we write massive autobiographies<br />
I heard the clanging clunk of the cinema bell<br />
In my reverie
</p>

<p>
There was a boy on the screen, apologetically<br />
Offering, offering a pet bird to a priest<br />
We had the one ambition: to grow up quickly and be<br />
In the privilege of the relevant authority<br />
I remembered my tear-ducts existed and worked, like land mines they hurt
</p>

<p>
So then it proved impossible to answer understandable<br />
FAQs from them
</p>

<p>
I heard the clanging clunk of the cinema bell<br />
In my reverie
</p>

<p>
I had a fast and full recovery<br />
Enjoying grapes and 7-UP<br />
Whereupon the sacred heart above me interrupts:
</p>

<p>
“Do you want to come to a better town with me, town with me?<br />
Do you want to come to a better town with me, town with me?<br />
Do you want to come to a better town with me, town with me?”
</p>

<p>
They would have stayed awake for anyone else
