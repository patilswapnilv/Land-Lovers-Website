<h1>Paddy Works The Maglev</h1>

<p>
In the year 2041, and my chrome all-in-one I put on<br />
The New York to London vactrain had just begun<br />
Working on the Maglev<br />
I'm weary of the Maglev
</p>

<p>
Allow me to chart the decline of our poor insignificant island<br />
We fell from a giddy good time to be<br />
Sinister amusements<br />
For travellers from Thailand<br />
Dreaming of the Maglev
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm weary of the Maglev<br />
Oh, been working on the Maglev all day<br />
Oh, working on the Maglev
</p>

<p>
I don't understand the advanced ins-and-outs of these grim economics<br />
My old pair remember a bright day when we<br />
Collected plots of land and<br />
Consumer electronics
</p>

<p>
But somewhere their choices were mad, they were drunk when they voted in dribs and in drabs<br />
And, slowly, the companies made for the shore<br />
Leaving monolithic husks in their wake<br />
Leaving like the maglev
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm weary of the Maglev<br />
Oh, been working on the Maglev all day<br />
Oh, working on the Maglev
</p>

<p>
Programmers to prostitutes<br />
Estate agents found work in the hostels at least<br />
The remaining ones, physicaly able and semi-skilled<br />
Found that their prospects increased<br />
If they departed, discarded their brains<br />
And laid down the tracks for that old vactrain
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm weary of the Maglev<br />
Oh, been working on the Maglev all day long<br />
Oh, working on the Maglev
</p>

<p>
Been workin' on it<br />
Workin' on it<br />
Been workin' on it<br />
Workin' on it
</p>
