<h1>Immovable Feet</h1>

<p>
I was born with feet of lead<br />
And I never had them replaced<br />
But I know too well that's everyone's line<br />
And with my feet of lead<br />
I'd tread the boards unfailingly<br />
Stepping on the wrong toes in the wrong time
</p>

<p>
Other guys maybe fantasise<br />
Of twirling tiny dancers before their eyes<br />
To me, that's no prize
</p>

<p>
Oh no (come on, come on!)<br />
Oh no (come on, come on!)<br />
Oh no (come on, come on!)<br />
Oh no (come on, come on!)
</p>

<p>
And like I mentioned before, I have no place on the floor<br />
I can't dance to a beat, I've got immovable feet<br />
I got us theatre seats, I left the tickets on her dresser<br />
Instead of dancing, I'll impress her
</p>

<p>
If there ever comes a day<br />
When people once again go dancing<br />
In pairs, then quite alone shall I be<br />
And on that gloomy day<br />
I'll drag these weighty soles of mine<br />
To Bray, have them anchor me in the sea
</p>

<p>
And even though my feet are heavy-o<br />
A suit of lead I'll wear 'cos it fits me so<br />
And it keeps me below
</p>

<p>
Oh no (come on, come on!)<br />
Oh no (come on, come on!)<br />
Oh no (come on, come on!)<br />
Oh no (come on, come on!)
</p>

<p>
And like I mentioned before, I have no place on the floor<br />
I can't dance to a beat, I've got immovable feet<br />
We could play guess-the-guest-speaker at the film club lecture<br />
So, instead of dancing, let's conjecture
</p>

<p>
Let's see that echoey band play to a few fans<br />
No matter how good they are, nobody will dance<br />
Crisps and red lemonade where there's no music played<br />
The only rhythm in there is that of bets laid.
