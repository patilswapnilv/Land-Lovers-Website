<h1>Paul Treacy Probably Knows</h1>

<p>
There bloweth that straw again<br />
He doesn't really want to be your boyfriend<br />
Too pitiful for that thought<br />
His politics are funny and his nerves are fraught
</p>

<p>
Does he even know the difference<br />
Between a teenage stage and the lifelong rages that he sang about?<br />
On the first sunny day in a long time<br />
He's the grubbiest boy in the room
</p>

<p>
Chorus:<br />
Paul Treacy probably knows<br />
That you don't solicit for his feelings<br />
He wants the power to glow,<br />
But dimly, once in a while
</p>

<p>
You'll understand all his words<br />
Some art is so impenetrable that it hurts<br />
But he writes a good murder tale<br />
Sets it to a drone and an offensive wail
</p>

<p>
Once elected, all the cinemas<br />
Shall be obliged to shut down for one night in deference to his honesty<br />
And the clones will decide they don't love him<br />
Leaving you at his court on your own
</p>

<p>
Chorus<br />
<br />
And if he has a problem<br />
With your impassioned dedication<br />
It's just the level of injustice that you<br />
Can use to fuel your own creations
</p>
