<h1>The Whip Hand</h1>

<p>
Here she comes<br />
She wears a bicycle pattern on her school skirt<br />
Of claret, black and grey<br />
</p>

<p>
Taking turns<br />
Which one to piss right off? Which one to give hope to?<br />
In the mustard heat of day
</p>

<p>
Holding the whip hand forever<br />
Gripping her ankles under the overpass<br />
I thought it couldn't last
</p>

<p>
Chorus:<br />
'Cos everybody knew she held the will<br />
And everybody knew she held the whip hand<br />
Too brazen to miss<br />
The whip hand, the stick and the kiss
</p>

<p>
Rubber gloves<br />
Flung down, now what's gone wrong? What's the wagon done now<br />
That she hasn't done before?
</p>

<p>
Nothing much<br />
This is a routine call, keep an eye upon her<br />
That's all, and you won't hear from me anymore
</p>

<p>
Holding the whip hand forever<br />
Gripping her ankles under the overpass<br />
I thought it couldn't last
</p>

<p>
Repeat Chorus<br />
<br />
'Cos everybody knew she held the will<br />
And everybody knew she held the whip hand<br />
And all of the evidence shows
</p>

<p>
She held the whip hand, woah-oh<br />
She held the whip hand, woah-oh<br />
etc, etc.
