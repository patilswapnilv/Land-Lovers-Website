<h1>Black Country</h1>

<p>
Let me take you out to the Black Country tonight<br />
And we can stay there for a while<br />
Somewhere that will bore, with no attractions, with nothing to do<br />
So as to have your ear, if not the rest of you
</p>

<p>
And if the blue sky beckons you<br />
Look to the ground and listen once more<br />
To a little illuminated what-for<br />
Every patch lies covered by an eyesore
</p>

<p>
Let me take you out to the Black Country so bleak<br />
And we can stay there for a week<br />
In minute detail, I will outline my position on your decision<br />
To make a clean break with cruel precision
</p>

<p>
And if the dross dissuaded you<br />
Look in my eyes and tell me what for<br />
And if it's me you'll drop in an eyesore<br />
In an eyesore
</p>
