<h1>Modern Romance</h1>

<p>
M-O-D-E-R-N R-O-M-A-N-C-E!<br />
</p>

<p>
We met on really good terms<br />
Straight to the matter of swapping germs<br />
THe swapping of phrases was feeble<br />
Though I made the first attempt<br />
And you quickly echoed the sentiment:<br />
"Yes, it's quite warm here for April"
</p>

<p>
No sequels anymore!<br />
No FM104!<br />
No pandering to swaggering bores!<br />
<br />
'Cos you booked my place in Modern Romance (x2)<br />
<br />
Come on, come on Modern Romance!
</p>

<p>
Born to the Empire late<br />
Our correspondence would imitate<br />
That of historical figures<br />
But only in fits and spurts<br />
The effort to make an impression hurts<br />
So we wrote as ourselves again<br />
<br />
'Cos you booked my place in Modern Romance (x2)
</p>

<p>
We got that jet-fuel feeling<br />
And built a better home for it<br />
Everyone knows<br />
You give them one good reason<br />
To be a little cold<br />
They'd come down from the hillsides for it<br />
Crying "MODERN ROMANCE! MODERN ROMANCE! MODERN ROMANCE MUST DIE!!!"
