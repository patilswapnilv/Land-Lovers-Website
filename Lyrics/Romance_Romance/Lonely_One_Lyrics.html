<h1>The Lonely One</h1>

<p>
There I was alone, four nights out of every five<br />
Unproductive on the fifth, four-fifths alive
</p>

<p>
And yes, I'm the Lonely One<br />
But I am only lonely with you
</p>

<p>
Save yourself tonight, save yourself the trouble I'm<br />
Overactive as it is and tied for time
</p>

<p>
And yes, I'm the Lonely One<br />
But I am only lonely with you
</p>

<p>
When the lonely hearts living in the world agree<br />
Their best interests would be served seperately
</p>

<p>
Well then all the lonely ones<br />
Would emerge from their loneliness free
