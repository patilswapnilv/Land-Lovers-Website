<h1>Novel Rus</h1>

<p>
Do you see girls in the distance?<br />
Sent to the province of S.<br />
Weighed down with fear and satchels<br />
Coal tokens under duress
</p>

<p>
The world of daughters is closed to them<br />
And, shivering, we've worn out that seam<br />
It was a novel ruse
</p>

<p>
Valentina, lost to commerce<br />
Just as our Alyosha to blades<br />
I had dreamed I'd see her happy<br />
Walk in her great gala parade
</p>

<p>
The world of sentiment fell on the day<br />
We bargained our children for warmth<br />
In a novel ruse
</p>

<p>
The words of emmisaries jumbled our thoughts<br />
And, shivering, we plumped for the heat
</p>

<p>
It was a novel ruse on our part<br />
If we'd known just where it leads<br />
To a bed of broken hearts<br />
To a rumbling on the fields<br />
Novel ruse, and it felt<br />
Bloody awful to conveive<br />
Should I hang from a belt?<br />
Should I take my cue and leave?
