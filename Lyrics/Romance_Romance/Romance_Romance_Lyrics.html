<h1>Romance Romance</h1>

<p>
Romance romance, those old sycophants dribbling sacrifice<br />
Romance romance, it holds them entranced, shows them a paradise<br />
</p>

<p>
Romance is a danger to us<br />
All over town the romantics pursue us<br />
Breathing over our shoulders<br />
Threatening swift and irrational revenge<br />
Romance (REVENGE!)<br />
Romance (REVENGE!)<br />
Romance romance
</p>

<p>
Romance romance, resist its advance, send it mixed messages<br />
Romance romance, deny it a dance, the stuff that it presages
</p>

<p>
Is classed as a danger to us<br />
All academia wants to eschew us<br />
Glowering over their glasses<br />
Wishing us many romantic returns<br />
Romance (RETURN!)<br />
Romance (RETURN!)<br />
Romance romance
</p>

<p>
Oh Espana! Grievous and funny and fat<br />
In my frustration I cursed your creation<br />
Now show me the romance in that<br />
I'm afraid of the human characteristics awarded to lands like you<br />
By necro-romantics and closet Falangists<br />
They don't love you the way I do...
</p>

<p>
Romance romance<br />
Romance romance<br />
Romance
</p>
