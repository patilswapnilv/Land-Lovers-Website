<h1>Dark Secret</h1>

<p>
Baby I'm too schooled for cool<br />
The world labours 'neath my ridicule<br />
Showbiz taught me all I know:<br />
Impress those on top and despise those below
</p>

<p>
And have some dark secret, some dark secret<br />
Hidden in your lyrics, dear<br />
Have some dark secret, some dark secret<br />
Indiscretions left unclear
</p>

<p>
Chorus:<br />
All I want is someone I can blame<br />
Man of smoke to man of flame<br />
Some dark secret took a hold and light's away<br />
We didn't leave it unknown<br />
It was our one dark secret.
</p>

<p>
Graded on a decimal scale<br />
Where four out of ten is a hopeless fail<br />
I give Johnny Borrell five<br />
He's piss-poor on record, but he's not bad live
</p>

<p>
Is there some dark secret, some dark secret<br />
Hidden in his lyrics, friends?<br />
Is there some dark secret, some black closet?<br />
Does he make his racket to make amends?
</p>

<p>
Chorus<br />
<br />
All I want is someone I can blame<br />
Man of smoke to man of flame<br />
Man of smoke to man of flame, etc, etc.
