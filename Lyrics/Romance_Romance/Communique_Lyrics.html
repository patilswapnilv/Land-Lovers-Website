<h1>No. 1 Communiqué</h1>

<p>
(Every boy)<br />
Every boy drawn to the Capuchins, calm and mute<br />
(Every girl)<br />
And every girl who drags on that veil<br />
(Oooooooh)<br />
Takes a vow - be quiet, compliant and frail
</p>

<p>
(In the dorms)<br />
Adorning our walls: Camara, Camillo Torres<br />
(Our guitars)<br />
Heard in the main hall, no scholarly sleep<br />
(Oooooooh)<br />
And no sanctuary deep
</p>

<p>
You can go down to every nightclub you see<br />
Disregard the peasants<br />
You can go down to every nightclub you see<br />
Oh baby
</p>

<p>
Chorus:
We sent a letter to the NME<br />
We called it No. 1 Communiqué<br />
We are the Tigers in the Seminary<br />
We're seventeen and we are healthy<br />
Good heavens
</p>

<p>
(When the calls)<br />
Arrive from the music press: one, then three, then five<br />
(We'll ensure)<br />
They know liberation in gospels is truly alive<br />
Every collared rebel do the just and gentle jive
</p>

<p>
You will go down to every nightclub you see<br />
Disregard the peasants<br />
You will go down to every nightclub you see<br />
On no, not we
</p>

<p>
You saw our letter in the NME<br />
We called it No. 1 Communiqué<br />
We are the Tigers in the Seminary<br />
We rise with God against the wealthy<br />
<br />
Repeat chorus
</p>
