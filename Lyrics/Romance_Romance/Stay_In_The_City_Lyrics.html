<h1>Stay in the City</h1>

<p>
We're on the road to Persephone's<br />
We've brought her all the good cheer of our urbanised lives<br />
Fresh from the popular dives
</p>

<p>
We've disappeared in the throes of<br />
A latter passion, our hearts are heaving, our friends<br />
Our friends are leaving
</p>

<p>
Leaving their homes from a life less wasteful - don't!<br />
There's nothing out there<br />
The proise of roads and all a shopper can bear
</p>

<p>
Chorus:<br />
Here she comes into my eyeline<br />
Here she comes into the natural world again
</p>

<p>
You take a left at the cinema<br />
Onto an avenue named after foliage or stones<br />
The brick fields of loans serviced by loans
</p>

<p>
In any case the fourth right entrance<br />
Leads to a family-of-four life sentence, then<br />
You can just give me a call
</p>

<p>
Chorus<br />
<br />
Stay in the City<br />
Stay in the City<br />
Stay in the City, it's built for people
</p>

<p>
Leaving their homes from a life less wasteful - don't!<br />
There's nothing out there<br />
The proise of roads and all a shopper can bear<br />
Under one poxy roof
</p>

<p>
Here she comes! (I don't know what to do with her)<br />
Here she comes! (I don't know what to say to her)<br />
Here she comes! (I don't know what to do with her)<br />
Here she comes! (I don't know what to say to her)<br />
Here she comes! (I never did improve on her actions)<br />
etc, etc.
